      <p>Any chord can be inverted. This should also include (or lead to) discussing voicing, where notes above the root are moved into higher octaves, or multiplied. There are mumbo-jumbo ways to describe inversions, but to me the simplest is to say that you bring the notes up in a stack; for example in triads, the first inversion brings the root up to the higest note, the second inversion will bring the root and third up (so fifth is lowest). Inversions can be combined with voicing. As an example, if the root and fifth are both brought up, leaving the third as the lowest note, this would still be a first inversion, with the 5th being voiced. So it may be appropriate to define it by which note is being left as the lowest position. It may also be worth pointing out that this explains how combinations that may appear odd are better spoken of as inversions, such as a "root-4-m6" actually being a 1st inversion of a major triad (3-5-root).</p>
