      <p>Write your info down here!</p>
      <p>Voicing is the playing of the notes of a chord out of order (or even omitted). It can be a helpful when playing through chord progeressions, to either make them easer to play or add musical variety.</p>
      <p>Discuss closed vs open position: closed is where all tones are as close together as possible (often within one octave). Open can spread tones over multiple octaves.</p>
      <p>Inversions: a type of voicing where notes are played out of tonic order. For example, a C major triad is C-E-G, but it can be played where E is the lowest note (written C/E, the 1st inversion), or G is the lowest note (written C/G, the 2nd inversion).</p>
