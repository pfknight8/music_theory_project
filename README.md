## Description

This project is my first project built with TypeScript. It is based on an old excel file that I built to teach myself music theory while learning the bass guitar. I figured it would make for a simple enough project to follow, whilest being a deep enough subject for adding more complex functionality over time. The goal is to get/maintain practice with TypeScript and React.
