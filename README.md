# Music Theory Application
---

## Description

#### This project is based on an old excel file of mine that I built to teach myself music theory while learning the bass guitar. I figured it would make for a simple enough project to follow, whilest being a deep enough subject for adding more complex functionality over time. This project serves as my first foray into coding in public, and it also is my first project built with TypeScript and React.
