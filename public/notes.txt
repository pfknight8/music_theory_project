I have the chord creator working on a basic array, using semitones in order to get the notes that are a part of the chord. This works well in a technical sense, but causes some errors in the way things actually work in written music.
For example, a diminished A-flat chord is currently written as {A-flat + B + D}, which would make it look like a {1-2-4} scheme as written, but conventionally I believe the idea would be to keep it in a {1-3-5} scheme (more specifically {root-m3-d5}) with the letters and append accidentals, such as {A-flat + C-flat + E-doubleflat}. Notice, C-flat is enharmonic to B (natural), and E-doubleflat would be enharmonic to D (natural), so long as we are talking 12-TET.

I should attempt to add this correction into the program, but for now, we'll focus on making the app work generally, and get into the weeds later.

This code can be useful if ever let users type in a note:
// CharCodeAt(0), 65-90 for A to G.
if (noteSelect.charCodeAt(0) < 65 || noteSelect.charCodeAt(0) > 71){
  alert('Not a valid note!')
}
